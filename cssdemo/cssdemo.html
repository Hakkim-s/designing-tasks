      He settled with the SEC in September 2018 for making alleged "false

      He landed in the US as a transfer student at the University of

      The Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 7 passengers to and
      from Earth orbit, and beyond. The pressurized section of the capsule is
      designed to carry both people and environmentally sensitive cargo. Towards
      the base of the capsule and contained within the nose cone are the Draco
      thrusters, which allow for orbital maneuvering. Dragon’s trunk not only
      carries unpressurized cargo but also supports the spacecraft during
      ascent. The trunk remains attached to Dragon until shortly before reentry
      into Earth’s atmosphere. Designed in-house by SpaceX, each custom-tailored
      suit is meant to provide a pressurized environment for all crew members
      aboard Dragon in atypical situations such as cabin depressurization. This
      suit also routes communications and cooling systems to the astronauts
      aboard during regular flight. Additional features include the following:
      3D printed space suit helmet Touchscreen compatible gloves Flame resistant
      outer layer Hearing protection during ascent and reentry Single connection
      point between the suit and vehicle Heel sliders securing feet to footrest
